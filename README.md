# Cybersecurity Journey

This repository documents my learning journey in cybersecurity from scratch.

It includes notes, hands-on practice documentation, and reflections as I build a solid foundation in cybersecurity.

## Repository structure
- cybersecurity-fundamentals: core concepts and foundational notes
- tryhackme-labs: hands-on practice documentation
- learning-notes: personal notes and reflections

This repository is a work in progress and will evolve as I continue learning.
